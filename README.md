# Quora-Duplicate-Question-Detection
In this project we examined various methods to detect if pairs of questions from
the Quora Dataset are semantically the same. All of these methods encode two
questions in some way and then process these encoded question
representations to obtain a binary output. There were two main techniques that
we explored in this project: use of various distance metrics (like element-wise
product of two vectors) to encode the distance information between two question
representations as an additional input (Siamese Architecture) and the use of an
Attention Mechanism.
